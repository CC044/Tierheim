> ## Attribution: How, when and where?
> If you think that the least you can do is thank the authors for the resources they’ve created, this is one way of doing it: you can include an attribution line, such as “Designed by Freepik” on the final product or design, whether it’s a digital or a physical product.
> 
> ## Websites, blogs, e-books, newsletters
> Usually, the best place to add the attribution line is next to the asset downloaded from Freepik and a link to our website (www.freepik.com). There are other alternatives, such as placing it in the footer of your website, blog or newsletter.
> 
> The attribution must be always clear, visible and easy to find for your users or clients.
